arrays in java
arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable .we use indexes to get back the values.

why we should learn arrays,
if we have to store a lot of values .it becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.

syntax of arrays
we can create arrays in two different ways.
First way of creating arrays
     datatype[]arr={element 1,element 2,element 3};
     System.out.println(arr[])
second way of creating arrays
     datatype[]arr=new datatype[Size]
