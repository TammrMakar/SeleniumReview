Abstraction:
Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only shwoing the functionality to the user.
in java, we can achieve this in two ways
1-Abstract classes
2-interface
Interface:
is very similar to a class .we can have private methods static methods default methods abstract method we can be static in an interface.
we cant have instance fields in an interface. we cant have instance fields in an interface and because we don't have instance fields we also can't have a constructor in an interface.

Why we should learn about interface:
when objects are closely related to each other and there is a "Is a" relationship between then we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction.
if objects are not realated to each aother then we should iumplement abstraction with the help of interfaces.
