OOP(Object oriented programming):
Its just a way of writing code.that follows certain rules or guidelines.
we create classes that have attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behaviourism.

why we should we learn OOP?
1-it simplifies the software development and maintenance.(adding new features changing the existing code)
2-code duplication is reduced.
3-it also helps us represent something from real life with the help of classes and objects.
class:
is a blueprint or a design from which actual real life objects are created.
computer uses a class to che k what that class can do
Scanner Scan=new Scanner(System.In) here Scanner is class & scan is an object of scanner class .
with the help of object we can use the methods from a class we can also use properties from the class
Object:
Objects are created from classes and  we can use them to call methods and the properties from those classes.
Note:
Inside a class sequence does not matter you can define the methods first or the properties first
but when we are inside a method then sequence metters.
