Polymorphism:
polymorphism allows us to perform same action in different ways.there are two types of polymorphism
early binding static compile time runtime or late binding.polymorphism that is acheived with the help of method overloading
is called early or compile time polymorphism.when we achieve the polymorphism
with the help of method overriding it is called run time polymorphism

Why we should learn Polymorphism?
polymorphism allows us to write less code and call multiple methods.

polymorphism Syntax:
1-for static polymorphism we only need to overload a method.
2-for the dynamic polymorphism we need to extend from a class we need to override the methods from the parent class
class that we want to us in polymorphism.

final Keyword:
there are three main uses of the final keyword
1-when we use the final keyword with a variable we cant change its value once it is assigned .
2-when we have create constants then we declare the variables as final.
3-when we use it with a class no other class can inherit from that class.

Abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to user.
Why we should use Abstraction
1-it reduces the code complexity.
2-it allows the end user to focus using the features instead of worrying about the implementation

Syntax:
we need to declare the methods as abstract if we are not planning to provide the implementation.
we also need to write the abstract keyword with the class as well.
