2D Arrays:
    are arrays that contain 1D arrays.
Why we should learn abaut 2D arrays.
Because they allow us to store multiple and D arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data
for example if we have to store data from excel files we can use 2D Arrays.
Syntax to create 2D Arrays:

First way:
datatype[][] nameofArray=new datatype[size of rows][];
Second way:
datatype[][] nameofArray=new datatype{{data,data,data;}}

System.out.println(matrix[2][4]);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(matrix[0]));

System.out.println(matrix[1][i]);
int[]arr=matrix[1];// getting complete first array from 2D array
System.out.println(arr[i]);

sum = sum + numbers[i][j];
sum+=numbers[i][j];
sum++;


OOP i nothing but some set of rules that if we follow achieve below
1-representing real of rules that if we follow we achieve
1-code repetition is minimized
2-changing existing code and adding new features becomes easier.
3-Helps write sceure code.
