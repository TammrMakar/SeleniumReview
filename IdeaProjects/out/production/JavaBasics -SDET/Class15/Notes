Methods in Java:
   Is just a collection of java statements and blocks of code like if else loop printlns etc.

  why should we learn about methods:
  1) it allows us to simply large as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods
  for them build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application
  2) Methods allow us to re-use code.
  3) methods allow us to re flexible.
How can we create methods?
  there are two types built in and user defined.
Built in methods?
the methods which are designed by java developers for example the println() nextInt() method in the scanner class length()
present in String class they are all built in methods.
User defined methods:
They methods that we write.
Methods which return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.


int add(int a.int b){
return a+b;
}
int =>return type of a method
add=> name of the method
(int a,int b)=>parameters of the method or the input to the method
{ => body of the method
}
Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of same type.
======================================================================================
There are tree types of variables with respect to their scope
Local variables :
if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method ,loop , if condition etc. there are called local variables
Upside:
Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.You should always try to write code with the help of local variables.
Downside:
they can't be accessed outside the block in which they are created .they have very limited scope.
instance variables:
all the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables
upside:
we can use them in all the instance methods of that class.their scope is larger than local variables;
downside:
They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.
Static variables:
all the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are called static variables.
