When we should use String class:
 When we want to save as much memory as possible,and we are okay if the programs a little slow.
 When we should use StringBuilder class:
 when we want maximum speed, and we don't care how much memory our programs going to occupy.
 What dose it mean by String is immutable:
 it means String are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer,and the reason they are immutable is because same memory cell can be shared across many variables and if allow
 any of the variable to change the value it can break the complete system.
